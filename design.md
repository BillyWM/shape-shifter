## Abstraction levels
- Group level
    - grid, column, row
    - (perhaps others if grouped in complex shapes. "in a circle" etc)
- Shape level
    - One shape in the group

Properties can contextually refer to either the group or shape

### Advanced grouping

- Groups in groups? (grids in grids etc)
- Layers?

## Transforms
scale
    grow/shrink
rotation
translation
    move left/right up/down
    follow path


## Assumptions

When a description isn't explicit about all possible properties,
the runtime will have to make certain assumptions

- **Grid spacing**
    1. grid will fill the whole area
    2. items will be evenly spaced apart
