```
    make a 4x4 grid of circles
        each one shrinks and grows opposite each other

    [...or...how about]

        each one shrinks and grows slightly quicker than the last
```
------------------------
```
    make an 11x11 grid of squares
        colored cyan, yellow, cyan...
        spinning left, right, left...


    <<can we do 'cyan ones spin right yellow ones spin left?>>
    <<too complicated to have runtime remember and figure things out as complexity grows?>>
```
------------------------
```
    make a 10 by 10 grid of shapes
        most are wedges
        25/50/75/100% full
        blue teal white seafoam
        a few are small circles
        rotate the wedges in 4 steps at 1RPS
        rotate half forwards half backwards
```
------------------------

```
    make four columns of shapes
        circles in even columns, squares in odd
        4-7 shapes each
        columns move up and down opposite directions
```

```
    define a Springy Boi/Bois
        two circles connected by a line
        the circles move away from each other and back in
```
